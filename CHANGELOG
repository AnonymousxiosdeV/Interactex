- return to library mode after hiding iphone when having iphone object selected
- objects cannot be moved anymore when they reach the canvas boundaries
- clothe bounding box not working properly when zoomed
- fixed flickering while dragging projects in selection screen

- bug activity indicator not always showing
- changed sound names for the sound object
- when starting project from hardware mode, the hardware objects (boards) are not hidden
- object properties become white after started dragging connection
- board autoroutes only plus and minus
- selected object gets moved in hardware mode when connection mode is on
- bug crashes when duplicating board
- imageview does not restore image after project reopened

- attached hardware elements bounding box does not scale when layer zoomed
- iphone screen does not hide with iphone after restarting the editor
- connections cannot be seen behind iphone view
- fixed bug timer not working anymore

- palette properties empty when selecting element and switching to library mode and back to properties mode

**New Features**
- add description contact Katharina for custom designed lilypads

table, the object connected to that method should be highlighted, together with its connection.
- the Autoroute option in the property's pane of a hardware element should only be enabled in the hardware mode
- dragging iOS objects slow when they collide with the iPhone's walls
- contact Book shows null when names are not provided
- switch's label in canvas says "button"
- hardware switch naming not counting properly when a iphone switch in project
- when iphone selected and switched to hardware mode, the palette looks blank.
- LSM Compass not working on client when project transferred from the Designer
- i2c components not added to board when wired automatically

———Interactex v2.25 and v2.30———

**Bug Fixing**
Fixed bug: some elements not displaying selection box when selected
Fixed bug: sometimes long tap on a palette item cause the app to crash.
Fixed bug: connection between a String and a Number cause the app to crash when simulating it. MethodInvokeAction
Fixed bug: connections between object 2 and object 1 overlap
Fixed bug: volume in THMusicPlayer not working in iOS 7 anymore. Check MPVolumeView
Fixed bug: UI delays to update the upload button's image after a connection has been received and the pushButton has been set to enabled in the THProjectViewController
Fixed bug: Projects in selection screen are deleted when moving them
Fixed bug: Connection Nodes at wrong position after creation
Fixed bug: Connections between objects and comparator object not removed automatically when connecting third object to the comparator. (might be same problem for the grouper) 
Fixed bug: crashes when connecting grouper to label. Is it because the method is missing in the EditableObject? Check the bug fixing from me and Timm
Fixed bug: project images not shown on project selection screen
Fixed bug: display connection and highlight elements from the grouper properties pane
Fixed bug: highlight elements from the comparison properties pane (not only connection)
Fixed bug: fix bug when adding more than two elements to the grouper
Fixed bug: hardware elements not updating name in canvas (check name field in the properties pane)
Fixed bug: crashes when contactBook call method is invoked
Fixed bug: monitoring element is wider than the iPhone's screen, make few pixels smaller
Fixed bug: temperatureSensor paletteItem label text wrapped (maybe make few pixels wider)
Fixed bug: opengl draw errors after random combinations of actions in the canvas (Selecting elements, adding elements)
