Created by Juan Haladjian on 31/05/2012.

Interactex Designer is a configuration tool to easily setup, simulate and connect e-Textile hardware with smartphone functionality. Interactex Client is an app to store and replay projects made with Interactex Designer.

The first version of the software was designed and implemented as part of "Wearable M2M", a joint project of UdK Berlin and TU Munich, which was founded by Telekom Innovation Laboratories Berlin. It has been extended with funding from EIT ICT, as part of the activity "Connected Textiles".

Interactex is built using the Tango framework developed by TU Munich.

In the Interactex software, we use the GHUnit (a test framework for iOS developed by Gabriel Handford) and cocos2D libraries (a framework for building 2D games and graphical applications developed by Zynga Inc.).

Interactex also implements the Firmata protocol. Its software serial library is based on the original Arduino Firmata library.

/*!
 View verification test case.

 Supports GHVerifyView, which renders a view and compares it against a saved
 image from a previous test run.

     @interface MyViewTest : GHViewTestCase { }
     @end

     @implementation MyViewTest

     - (void)testMyView {
       MyView *myView = [[MyView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)];
       GHVerifyView(myView);
     }

     @end

 In order to record results across test runs, the PrepareUITests.sh script needs
 to be run as a build step. This script copies any test images (saved locally in
 $PROJECT_DIR/TestImages) to the app bundle so that calls to GHVerifyView have
 images from previous runs with which to compare.

 After changes to views are approved in the simulator, the CopyTestImages.sh script
 should be run manually in Terminal. This script copies any approved view changes
 back to the project directory. Images are saved with filenames of the following format:

     [test class name]-[test selector name]-[UIScreen scale]-[# of call to GHVerifyView in selector]-[view class name].png

 Note that because of differences in text rendering between retina and non-retina
 devices/simulators, different images are saved for test runs using retina then
 non-retina.

 Also note that there are commonly rendering differences across iOS versions.
 Therefore it is common for tests to fail when they are run using a different iOS
 version then the one that created the saved test image. This also applies to tests
 that are run at the command line (the xcodebuild flag '-sdk iphonesimulator'
 usually corresponds to the latest iOS simulator available).
