Interactex Designer

Created by Juan Haladjian on 31/05/2012.

Interactex Designer is a configuration tool to easily setup, simulate and connect e-Textile hardware with smartphone functionality. Interactex Client is an app to store and replay projects made with Interactex Designer.

The first version of the software was designed and implemented as part of "Wearable M2M", a joint project of UdK Berlin and TU Munich, which was founded by Telekom Innovation Laboratories Berlin. It has been extended with funding from EIT ICT, as part of the activity "Connected Textiles".

Interactex is built using the Tango framework developed by TU Munich.

In the Interactex software, we use the GHUnit (a test framework for iOS developed by Gabriel Handford) and cocos2D libraries (a framework for building 2D games and graphical applications developed by Zynga Inc.).

Interactex also implements the Firmata protocol. Its software serial library is based on the original Arduino Firmata library.

/*!
 A collection of tests (or test groups).

 A test group is a collection of `id<GHTest>`, that may represent a set of test case methods. 
 
 For example, if you had the following GHTestCase.

     @interface FooTest : GHTestCase {}
     - (void)testFoo;
     - (void)testBar;
     @end
 
 The GHTestGroup would consist of and array of GHTest: FooTest#testFoo, FooTest#testBar, 
 each test being a target and selector pair.

 A test group may also consist of a group of groups (since GHTestGroup conforms to GHTest),
 and this might represent a GHTestSuite.
